    "\n",
    "Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and a scientific field of study which uses _Algorithms_ and _Statistics_ to perform specific _Tasks_ without _Explicit Instructions_ of how that has to be performed. This is done by statistical pattern recognition and inferencing relevant information from data.\n",
    "\n",
    "As of Today, Machine Learning is used widely in a variety of fields from [Self-Driving Cars](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2019/08/21/drive-labs-autonomous-vehicle-ride/), [Identifying Diseases in the Healthcare Industry](https://news.developer.nvidia.com/ai-automatically-detects-lung-abnormalities/) to [Generating Photorealistic Image from Doodles](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2019/03/18/gaugan-photorealistic-landscapes-nvidia-research/?ncid=so-you-n1-78256). \n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning is broadly classified Into three types:\n",
    "- *Supervised Learning*\n",
    "    - Given _Inputs_ and corresponding _Outputs_, the algorithms learns to _Map_ a _Function_ between _Inputs_ and _Outputs_ over an iterative optimization process, also called as _Training_. Example: You provide pictures of Cats and Dogs with labels of them and the algorithms can learn the relation between the input and the output. Algorithms that fall in this category are Support Vector Machine, Decision Trees and many other. \n",
    "- *Unsupervised Learning*\n",
    "    - We do not give any Targets (Labels) to the System, and it comes up with its way of understanding the data. Example : You give a bunch of Images of cats and dogs and you want to divide it into two piles , the algorithms goes through the images and learns to divide the images into these piles on it own. Algorithms that fall in this catgory are k-means, clustering and many other \n",
    "- *Reinforcement Learning*\n",
    "    - Reinforcement learning differs from other algorithms in a way that the training data has the answer key with it, so the model is trained with the correct answer itself whereas, in reinforcement learning, there is no answer, but the reinforcement agent decides what to do to perform the given task. In the absence of training dataset, it is bound to learn from its experience. Example include recent real-life achievements such as : AlphaGo is the first computer program to defeat a professional human Go player. \n",

    "\n",
    "Neural Networks are a set of algorithms modelled after human brain to recognize patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "The human brain consists of neurons or nerve cells which transmit and process the information received from our senses. Many such nerve cells are arranged together in our brain to form a network of nerves. These nerves pass electrical impulses, i.e. the excitation from one neuron to the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "*The same concept of the network of neurons is used in machine learning algorithms. In this case, the neurons are created artificially on a computer. Connecting many such artificial neurons creates an artificial neural network.*\n",

    "$x1,x2$ are inputs to the Neuron while $y$ is the output of the Neuron.This $x1,x2$ are then multiplied with $w1,w2$ respectively. \n",

    "\n",
    "$ y = a1*x1 + a2*x2 + \\dots + an*xn $ \n",
    "\n",

    "Why is this a Problem? Because lots of functions in the real-world are not necessarily linear. Think of a Classifier that has to classify if a specific latitude and longitude is part of the city or outside a city. In that case, the function can look something like this.\n",

    "## Hyper Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "A model hyperparameter is a configuration that is external to the model and whose value cannot be estimated from data.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are often used in processes to help estimate model parameters and is specified by the practitioner.\n",
    "They can often be set using heuristics.\n",
    "They are often tuned for a given predictive modelling problem.\n",
    "We cannot know the best value for a model hyperparameter on a given problem. We may use rules of thumb, copy values used on other problems, or search for the best value by trial and error.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a machine learning algorithm is tuned for a specific problem, such as when you are using a grid search or a random search, then you are tuning the hyperparameters of the model or it's order to discover the parameters of the model that result in the most skillful predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number and diversity of hyperparameters in machine learning algorithms are particular to each model. However, there some classic hyperparameters that we should always keep our eyes on and that should help you think about this aspect of machine learning solutions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Learning Rate**: The learning rate quantifies the learning progress of a model in a way that can be used to optimize its capacity. The learning rate also determine how we control the change to the weights, a lower value might take more time to converge while a large value might change the weights too much that we can miss a local minima.\n",
    "- **Epochs**: An epoch is defined as the number of times an algorithm visits the data set\n",
    "- **Batch Size**: The batch size is a hyperparameter of gradient descent that controls the number of training samples to work through before the model’s internal parameters are updated.\n",
    "- **The number of Hidden Units**: A classic hyperparameter in deep learning algorithms, the number of hidden units is vital to regulate the representational capacity of a model.\n",
    "- **Convolution Kernel Width**: In convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs), the Kernel Width influences the number of parameters in a model which, in turns, influences its capacity.\n"

    "Training is an tterative optimization process when the _Objective Function_ ( Loss Function ) is minimized using the _Optimizer_ and the set hyper parameters.\n",

    "\n",
    "Model Evaluation is an integral part of the model development process. It helps to find the best model that represents our data and how well the chosen model will work in the future. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Machine Learning we want our _Model_ to have a robust fit over the data and not _Overfit_ or _Underfit_ the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Underfitting** : When the _Model_ does not learn enough feature and is very simple to have properly understood the trend of the data.\n",
    "- **Overfitting** : When the _Model_ has learnt too much from the training data and has failed the _Generalise_ the data.\n",

    "- Validation Dataset: The sample of data used to provide an unbiased evaluation of a model fit on the training dataset while tuning model hyperparameters. The evaluation becomes more biased as skill on the validation dataset is incorporated into the model configuration.\n",
    "- Test Dataset: The sample of data used to provide an unbiased evaluation of a final model fit on the training dataset.\n",

    "The Test Accuracy of the Model is finally considered as the accuracy of the Model."
